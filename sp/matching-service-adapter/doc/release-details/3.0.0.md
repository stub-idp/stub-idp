# Support for European identities

The MSA now supports assertions issued by identity providers in other European countries. This is a requirement of the eIDAS regulation which comes into force in September 2018. If your service is in scope of the regulation, you will already have been contacted by the GDS.

To enable support for European identities, add the `europeanIdentity` section below to your [MSA configuration file](http://alphagov.github.io/rp-onboarding-tech-docs/pages/matching/matchingserviceadapter.html#in-the-field-europeanidentity).

```yaml
europeanIdentity:
  enabled: ${EUROPEAN_IDENTITY_ENABLED} # true or false
  hubConnectorEntityId: https://www.integration.signin.service.gov.uk/SAML2/metadata/connector # The URL of the metadata for the node that requests and receives identities from European countries.
  # Configure metadata for European countries.
  aggregatedMetadata:
    jerseyClientName: trust-anchor-client
    trustAnchorUri: https://www.integration.signin.service.gov.uk/SAML2/metadata/trust-anchor # The location of the trust anchor used to validate country metadata
    metadataSourceUri: https://www.integration.signin.service.gov.uk/SAML2/metadata/aggregator # The location of the aggregated country metadata
    trustStore: # The location and password for the truststore
      path: test_ida_metadata.ts
      password: puppet
```

If you enable support for European identities, the MSA will use the new [universal JSON matching schema](http://alphagov.github.io/rp-onboarding-tech-docs/pages/matching/buildmatchingservice.html#jsonschema) to pass matching datasets. This applies to datasets from both European countries, as well as GOV.UK Verify identity providers.

If you do not able support for European identities, the MSA will use the [legacy JSON matching schema](http://alphagov.github.io/rp-onboarding-tech-docs/pages/matching/legacyJSONschema.html#legacyjsonschema) to pass matching datasets from GOV.UK Verify identity providers.

# Upgrade to SHA-256

SHA-256 is now the default algorithm for signing and encrypting SAML messages.

To comply with the Identity Assurance Hub Service SAML 2.0 Profile, all connected services and certified companies must use RSA-SHA256 for the signature method algorithm and SHA-256 for the digest method algorithm in the SAML authentication requests.

If you need to revert to using SHA-1 for troubleshooting, use `shouldSignWithSHA1: true` in your [MSA configuration file](http://alphagov.github.io/rp-onboarding-tech-docs/pages/matching/matchingserviceadapter.html#configuremsa).
