# Entity ID (or IDs) that uniquely identifies your service (or services)
#
# `serviceEntityIds` is a JSON array, for example '["service-entity-id"]'.
# To connect more than one service to a single VSP deployment, add all the
# service entity IDs to the JSON array, for example:
# '["service-one-entity-id", "service-two-entity-id"]'
serviceEntityIds: ${SERVICE_ENTITY_IDS:-[]}

# Use `hashingEntityId` if you're connecting
# more than one service to a single VSP deployment.
#
# The VSP uses the `hashingEntityId` instead of the value in `serviceEntityIds`
# when generating a user's hashed personal identifier (PID). This is to make
# sure a user verified by a particular identity provider is linked to a unique
# hashed PID no matter which one of your services they're requesting to use.
