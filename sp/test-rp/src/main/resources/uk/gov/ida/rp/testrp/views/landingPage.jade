    .summary
      p This service allows you to test different GOV.UK Verify user journeys. Throughout the journey being tested, this service will stand in for a government service that uses GOV.UK Verify.
    p You can use this service to test the following user journeys: 
    ul
      li creating a new identity account with an identity provider
      li single IDP journey (creating an identity account following a prompt by a specific identity provider)
      li signing in with an existing identity account
      li pausing the verification process and continuing it later
    h2 Before you start

      a(href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/introducing-govuk-verify/introducing-govuk-verify#government-services") government service that uses GOV.UK Verify
